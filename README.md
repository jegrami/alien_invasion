# Alien Invasion

### instructor -- Eric Matthes 

Alien Invasion is my first building project as a student learning Python under the illustrious [Eric Matthes](https://ehmatthes.github.io/) It's my first experience with Pygame, the Python library for game development. 

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left with the arrow keys `➡`  `⬅` and shoot bullets with the spacebar. 

When the game begins, aliens fill the sky and move down and across the screen; the player shoots and kills the aliens. If the player kills all the aliens, a new fleet of aliens that move faster appears. If an alien hits a ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
